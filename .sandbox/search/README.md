# Search Sandbox

This directory contains some experiments and tests for the search feature.

As this project is currently a proof of concept, here some stuff that could be
added:
- make a better UI, maybe with React components
- order alphabetically/chronologically the results in real time
- allow to choose instances to explore and the limit of results by instance
- display hashtags statuses instead of a link to the instance page
